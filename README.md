# Extended-Kalman-Filter-for-Non-linear-Observation-Matrix
Extended Kalman Filter for Tracking Non-Linear Observation Matrix. Sometimes either the state or observation matrix is non-linear for which an extended kalman filter has to be used. 
This MATLAB project considers the problem of vehicle tracking as explained in Kay, "Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing:
Estimat ion Theory", pg. 456-466.
